Back in 2017, the idea of working remotely on my own schedule drew me into the world of coding. My first freelance project, a simple web scraper, took two weeks to complete but earned me $50 and sparked a passion for problem-solving and creating with code.

Since then, I’ve had the chance to work on some amazing projects. These include building SaaS for a US real estate investment startup, contributing to a large international cloud provider, and crafting cool products for a small animation studio, among many others.

My main focus these days is backend development, where I excel with frameworks like Django and FastAPI. On the frontend, I enjoy working with TailwindCSS and Alpine.js. I constantly explore new technologies and work on side projects to stay at the cutting edge of the field.

When I’m not at the computer, you can find me practicing Muay Thai, running, hitting the gym, or learning tennis. I’m passionate about traveling, cooking, trying new cuisines, and learning new languages. So far, I’ve lived in 🇵🇱 Poland, 🇦🇷 Argentina, 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland, and 🇧🇷 Brazil, and I speak four languages fluently. Additionally, I enjoy video games and writing.
